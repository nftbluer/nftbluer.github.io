        <p><em>Blur’s native token $BLUR launched for trading has been the hottest topic these days, so what is Blur?
                Can it shake up Opensea? Let’s find out together.</em></p>
        <p>Blur is an NFT marketplace built on the Ethereum mainnet and also a trading aggregator. Compared with other
            NFT marketplaces such as X2Y2 and LooksRare, which focus on retail users, Blur focuses more on Pro NFT
            traders.</p>
        <p>Specifically, Blur offers batch shelf and floor-sweeping transactions (which refer to buying multiple NFTs
            with the lowest price at once) on top of order book NFT transactions, providing traders with a more
            convenient batch operation. At the same time, buyers can not only see NFTs for sale on Blur, but also browse
            NFTs on other NFT marketplaces on Blur and place orders directly through Blur.</p>
        <p>In addition, Blur’s fee structure is also very friendly to traders, where the transaction fee is 0, i.e. Blur
            does not charge any fees from transactions. On the other hand, Blur is also more trader-friendly in terms of
            royalties, which are set by the creators on marketplaces such as Opensea and Rarible, and are compulsory for
            a certain percentage of secondary transactions. Blur recommends a default royalty rate of 0.5% for buyers,
            but buyers can also customize the royalty rate, even setting it to 0.</p>
        <h1>What Is TokenInsight’s Rating for Blur?</h1>

            completed on January 20, 2023. The audit mainly covers minor updates to the NFT marketplace and new
            governance modules. According to the report, a critical vulnerability in the governance module was
            identified and has not yet been fixed.</p>
        <p>Blur also runs a vulnerability bounty program on the code4rena, but does not make the official code base
            publicly available on GitHub. As of February 2023, Blur has not experienced any security-related crisis
            incidents.</p>

        <h1>Token Performance (59.93%)</h1>
        <p>$BLUR launched on February 15, 2023. As of February 22nd, $BLUR is available on OKX, Uniswap, DigiFinex,
            Coinbase, and many other exchanges. According to TokenInisght, $BLUR currently has the highest volume on
            OKX, accounting for 30% of total trading volume.</p>
        <p>The price of $BLUR reached over $2 at the beginning of the launch, and then quickly dropped to around $0.6.
            As Blur became more and more trending, the price of $Blur gradually rose to a high of around $1.4 in the
            following days. According to the latest data, on February 22, the price of $BLUR dropped back to around $1,
            which is about 30% lower than ATH.</p>
        <p>In terms of trading volume, $BLUR’s 24h spot trading volume reached more than $500 million on its first day
            launched, and the average daily volume for the following days remained stable at around $300 million, almost
            equal to its circulating market cap.</p>

        <h1>Ecosystem Development (56.4%)</h1>
        <p>Blur’s daily volume jumped from around $15 million before February 14 to over $80 million on the 15th, as a
            result of the $BLUR launch and subsequent incentive plan. Blur’s volume was not significantly impacted by
            OpenSea’s announcement on February 18 that it would launch a limited time 0 fee trading, with Opensea
            collecting $230 million in volume on that day.</p>
        <p>Blur has even overtaken Opensea by capturing more than half of the NFT marketplace share in terms of average
            daily volume over the past 30 days.</p>

        <p>While Blur has surpassed Opensea in terms of average daily volume, it still has a gap with Opensea in terms
            of daily active users. Blur’s average daily active users over the past 30 days is only about 5,000, while
            Opensea’s active users are three times higher than Blur’s, at over 15,000.</p>

        <h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
        <p>Blur, a new generation chanllenger, has become the largest among NFT marketplaces in terms of volume, shaking
            Opensea that had not been shaken in the past few years. But Opensea still has a strong user base, and Blur
            still needs to create more attractive products for Opensea’s loyal users. And in addition to PFP, artwork is
            also a big category for NFT, as we mentioned last year in our TokenInsight NFT Industry Report 2022 Jan —
            May, where artwork was second only to PFP, accounting for about 10% of the overall NFT market volume.
            Royalties are one of the main reasons why content creators choose NFT, and they are not destined to choose a
            marketplace if they can’t make any profit from secondary market sales. This is one of the issues Blur needs
            to think about.</p>
        <p>In addition, Blur, as a project that has not launched for long, has many common problems with emerging
            projects: no publicly available codebase, not detailed official docs, not enough native token usage, etc. As
            the project continues to evolve, we believe the Blur team will have more time to polish these parts that
            need improvement.</p>
